## 🌟 Features

- **Dynamic Fish Schooling**: A variety of fish species (including Blue Fish, Clownfish, Dory, and more) with randomized sizes, speeds, and vertical "bobbing" animations.
- **Interactive Parallax**: Elements respond to your mouse movement, creating a deep 3D effect between the background, fish layers, and overlays.
- **Atmospheric Effects**:
    - **God Rays**: Sun rays piercing through the water surface.
    - **Water Caustics**: Dynamic light reflections dancing on the scene.
    - **Marine Snow**: Floating particles and bubbles that add life to the environment.
- **Realistic Water Distortion**: Uses SVG turbulence and displacement filters to create a subtle, liquid-like moving effect.
- **Vintage Glass Overlay**: A subtle reflection effect that makes your screen look like a high-end cylindrical fish lamp.
- **Fully Customizable**: Adjust everything from fish count to parallax intensity via the Wallpaper Engine properties menu.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
